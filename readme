Let's consider the real-world problem of managing customer service requests in a call center. We'll solve this problem using various data structures like arrays, stacks,queues, linked lists, heaps, and trees.

Problem Description:
A call center receives customer service requests throughout the day. Each request needs to be addressed in a specific order, and some requests have higher priority than others. The call center also needs to keep track of resolved requests and revisit them if necessary.

Requirements:
1.Queue for handling incoming service requests in the order they are received.
2.Priority Queue (Heap) for handling high-priority requests.
3.Stack for revisiting recently resolved requests.
4.Linked List for maintaining a history of all requests.
5.Array for storing predefined common responses or solutions to frequent issues.
6.Tree for categorizing requests based on the type of issue.
